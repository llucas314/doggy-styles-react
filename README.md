# doggy-styles-react

This website allows you to find dogs with compatible temperaments(doggy styles). The idea for this project was inspired by my German Shorthaired Pointer, Preston, who I have trouble finding other dog breeds that match his intensity.

```

```

### Dependencies

A rundown of some dependencies used in this project:

- `react-router`: React Router was implemented so that I could render a “detailed view” for movies. With a larger scale project, it would be more useful in rendering additional views.
- `axios`: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- `doggystyle-complib`: A component library specifically made for this site

### Contributing

If you have any comments or suggestions please feel free to contact me through github.

### Future Additions

There are lots of features that we would like to add including building a React Native version, Facebook authentication, finding other users by location, improving the breed comparison algorithm, expanding on site content, and improving the overall styling.

### Final Thoughts

This was a great introduction to building an original full stack application as a team. We were able to overcome issues with work flow, merging branches, and persistent bugs. The couple of days allotted to build this application seems to pass quickly, but we were able to create and execute an effective plan of attack.
